# Insurance Fraud Detection Model

## Problem Statement
Insurance fraud is a growing issue in the insurance industry. Fraudulent claims result in significant financial losses for insurance companies, leading to increased premiums for honest policyholders. This project aims to provide a solution for detecting potential fraudulent insurance claims based on various factors and data inputs related to the policyholder, incident, and claim details.

## What This Model Does
This repository contains a web-based form for Insurance Fraud Detection. The form collects data about the policyholder, incident, and claim details. These details are then processed and used to predict whether a given insurance claim is fraudulent or not (though actual prediction functionality can be integrated later).

### The form includes inputs for:
- Customer information: Age, Months as Customer, Sex, and Education Level
- Policy details: Policy state, CSL, deductible, umbrella limit, etc.
- Incident specifics: Date, type of incident, severity, and more
- Claim details: Claim amounts, bodily injuries, property damage, and more

## Features
- Collects relevant insurance claim data for fraud detection.
- User-friendly and responsive form design.
- Basic styling and layout for better readability.
